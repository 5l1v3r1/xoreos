glew
****
   eos uses glew, The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
   (<<http://glew.sourceforge.net/>), to safely check for and use OpenGL 1.2+
   features and extensions. To minimize dependencies on "uncommon" libraries,
   eos completely includes the glew code, one of its suggested use methods.
   glew is licensed under the Modified BSD License, the Mesa 3-D License
   (MIT License), and the Khronos License (MIT License).

Bink
****
   The Bink decoder used in eos is based (very closely) on the Bink decoder in
   FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>), licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
   License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later.
