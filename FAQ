Q: Why "xoreos"?
A: BioWare's first 3D engine (developed for Neverwinter Nights) was called
   "Aurora", the Roman goddess of dawn. "Eos" is her Greek name, so it kind
   of fits.

Q: Will xoreos be able to play later versions of BioWare engine?
A: Maybe/Probably. Both the Odyssey (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   and its sequel) and the Electron (Neverwinter Nights 2) are based heavily
   on Aurora, keeping lots of basic file formats, and only extending other.
   I don't know anything about Eclipse (Dragon Age) or Jade Empire's
   engine, though.
   xoreos is meant primarily to get Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
   working, since there are already Linux and MacOS ports of Neverwinter
   Nights. However, my knowledge is grouped around the latter, so what will
   be implemented first depends on exactly how similar Aurora and Odyssey
   are.

Q: Will xoreos be able to play earlier versions of BioWare engine?
A: Probably not. The Infinity engine, while also having basic file formats
   in common, is isometric "2.5D", so using a complete different graphical
   model. It might be too different to get to integrate. Also, there
   already is a reimplementation of the Infinity engine, GemRB:
   <http://gemrb.sourceforge.net/>.

Q: Will there be something like the Aurora toolset that shipped with
   Neverwinter Nights, to create modules?
A: Maybe. My first wanderings into the Aurora engine was a try to create
   a library to be used as a base for a portable Aurora toolset. The code
   was really bad though, and I lost interest after having implemented
   base classes for most file formats.
