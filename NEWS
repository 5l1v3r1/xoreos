Changes in xoreos version 0.0.2
===============================

This is the first official release of xoreos, together with xoreos-tools.

In this first release, all targeted games work insofar as that they at least
show basic in-game areas. I.e. you can start the game, xoreos loads the game
resources, loads a campaign or module, and then shows an area of the game.

Within the area, you can fly around in a "spectator" mode, using the common
first-person WASD control scheme. Moving the mouse while holding down the
middle mouse button rotates the camera. With Ctrl+D, a debug console drops
down, allowing for general resource dumping and the loading of different
areas, modules and/or campaigns.

A few games, specifically Neverwinter Nights and Knights of the Old Republic,
also show a main menu, although the latter's is not as extensive yet. The
former also shows a few in-game menu elements.

Additionally, Neverwinter Nights also has a script system hooked up, and
preliminary dialogue support. This means that clicking on an NPC opens up
its conversation dialog, and some of the script commands will be executed.
For example, the door in the first area of the original campaign's prelude
opens after speaking to Bim and telling him that no tutorial is necessary.
However, triggering the tutorial leads to the scripts looping endlessly,
because the necessary game functions are not implemented yet.

Further gameplay is still missing. At the moment, none of the other games
have a script system.

The current graphics are very basic: only flat-shaded, textured meshes are
shown. No lighting, shadows or shaders of any kind are currently available.
